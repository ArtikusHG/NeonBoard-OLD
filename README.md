# NeonBoard
A small Logos-based theming engine for iOS that I made as an experiment. Works on iOS 7 - 12. Some features are kind of broken (I think)... Install from artikushg.github.io or using the deb from this repo.

P.S. f that shit where when you commit from root your github username is System Administrator :/
