this is the buggy version i wrote when i was like 13 (14? don't even remember lol). it barely supports anything. i just dont have the source code anywhere else other than here so i figured i wouldnt delete it idk

see new version here https://github.com/ArtikusHG/NeonBoard

original desc:

# NeonBoard
A small Logos-based theming engine for iOS that I made as an experiment. Works on iOS 7 - 12. Some features are kind of broken (I think)... Install from artikushg.github.io or using the deb from this repo.

P.S. f that shit where when you commit from root your github username is System Administrator :/
